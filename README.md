# Programming and Programming Languages

This repository contains lecture notes ([TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) Jupyter notebooks) for a 1 semester upper-level course on programming and programming languages. The basis for the lecture notes is a course taught at San Francisco State University (SFSU) in Fall 2021 and Spring 2022.


## Why this Class?

The hope of this class is to expose you to different ways of programming and how different programming languages support these ways of programming. Such a class is often taught using a non-main-stream langauge (e.g.,Scheme). Instead, we're using TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript. The advantage is that you'll come away learning a popular language that is widely used in web programming.


### Contents

1. Language primitives (i.e., building blocks of languages): lecture 02 - lecture 10.
   - pure functions and first-class functions
   - recursion
   - algebraic data-types
   - functional vs. object-oriented programming
2. Language paradigms (i.e., combinations of language primitives): lecture 11 - lecture 17.
   - domain-specific languages and declarative programming
   - concurrency
   - laziness
3. Building a language (i.e., designing your own language): lecture 18 - lecture 21.
   - interpreters and transpilers
   - meta-programming


#### Special Lectures

1. Lecture 13 explores [Sql](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/)
2. Lecture 15 explores [Go](https://go.dev/)
3. Lecture 17 explores [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)


### Why Jupyter + TypeScript?

Why not slides? Simply put, slides are a polished product that are not interactive and often do not show the thought proces and trial/error that goes into coming up with a piece of code that works. Jupyter + TypeScript enables you to explore concepts with actual code that you can modify.


## Requirements

1. [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
2. [Node/JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)


## Usage

1. `npm install` (first time)
2. `jupyter notebook`
